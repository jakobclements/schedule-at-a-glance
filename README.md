# Schedule at a Glance Deadline Tracker

### Purpose
The app will keep track of user submitted deadlines and provide an easily digestible summary/visualization of the user's upcoming day/week. My goal is to make it easier for users to organize and track their upcoming deadlines, and to be able to quickly understand what their upcoming day or week will be like because I find that traditional calendar apps are either too focussed on the current day, or too overwhelming with upcoming data points.
